\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize} 
\item 
Much of LSST science will be limited by systematic errors in the photometry. 
\item 
The importance of characterizing and eliminating/compensating for these systematics was recognized early on
\item
Paper discusses the suite of instruments developed, designed and fabricated to perform these analyses
\item
Presents performance and future uses
